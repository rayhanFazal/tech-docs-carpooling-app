# tech-docs-carpooling-app

This repository includes technical documention I created for a carpooling app called "antride" made by my colleague Sabih, and serves as one of my writing samples for my technical writing portfolio. I made these docs using Confluence. See section "Technical documentation / writing samples" below for more. 
Here is a link to the website itself:
[antride](https://ant-ride-1dvw.vercel.app/)

Also, below are the links to the frontend and backend code for the app if you're interested:

[frontend](https://github.com/kleenkanteen/ant-ride-backend/)

[backend](https://github.com/kleenkanteen/ant-ride)

This repository will continue to get updated as I am currently contributing docs for the carpooling app, and so there will be more documentation I will add to this repository.

NOTE: You may see that I frequently use "\<some-text\>" in my writing samples, this is just a placeholder for internal information used in the code for the carpooling app to maintain the privacy of sensitive
information in the codebase.

## Technical documentation / writing samples ##
I have organized the docs into folders based on what category each piece of documentation represents.
In each folder, I have named the files telling exactly what purpose they serve. Feel free to check out each of them to see
the documentation I made.

### Folders ###
- Guides: Contains how-to guides for developers
- References: Contains mainly API references and documentation (how to use the API) - IN PROGRESS
